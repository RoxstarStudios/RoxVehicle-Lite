## Recommendations
  - Use [DriveV](https://github.com/Weilher420/Drive-V-Fivem-port) along side this script as it makes vehicles handle much better and closer to real life, we will have a custom version modified with values we feel fit better with this script eventually
  - Use [Automobile Catalog](https://www.automobile-catalog.com/) to get torque values, gear ratios and top speeds for all vehicles
